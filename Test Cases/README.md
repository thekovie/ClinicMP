# Take Note
Place all programs here. Do not place it on the main folder so that it would not be included in the commits.

## How to set it up?
1. Run and compile the program. You should see the `.vscode` folder and able to generate a `tasks.json`.
2. Go to `tasks.json` then go to under `"tasks`.
3. Add `Test Cases` under args in between `${fileDirname}\\` and `\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe"`. Look at the photo below for reference.

# Reminder!
Do **not** press the ▶️ button on the top-corner of your screen! For it will generate the program under the main folder. Use `Ctrl + F5` instead.
